# map-creation-tool
for noah's raycasting engine

## I am not happy with how sprite support was implemented.
Before implementing any more features, which may or may not even happen, I plan to redo sprite code entirely.
No guarentees when this will happen as I'm pretty busy with school and stuff.

Add the github link to noah's raycasting project here in the future
